Simulation: Quantum Entanglement of Qubits

This simulation, does the following:

1) Generate a pair of entangled qubits in the Bell state. Bell states are typical examples of entangled states.

2) Simulate measurements in different bases on the qubits to demonstrate the correlation between them.

3) Visualize the correlation using a Bloch sphere or bar graphs to show how measurements in different bases are correlated.
